6.  Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

- Statically typed Languages
  A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. You as the programmer must specify what type each variable is;
  The advantage of this kind languages is that checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.
- Examples are :
  C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala

-Dynamically typed languages
A language is dynamically typed if the variable type is associated with run-time values. i.e the type of the variablesis interpreted at the run-time.You as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time.
-Exmples are:
JavaScript, Ruby.Python,PHP.

7.  Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined

- Undefine is a datatype in javascript while null is an object.
- Undefine means that a variable has been declared, but no value has been assigned to the variable while
  null in JavaScript is an assignment value, it can be assign to a variable

- For example;
  //undfine
  let demo;
  //null
  let demo= null;
